# Decompfrontier Server
This is an unofficial, **EXPERIMENTAL** C++ game server that aims to emulate the official server used for Brave Frontier (v2.19.6.0)

The source code will eventually be part of a "Brave Frontier Offline Mod" release started
in late 2022 which took inspiration from the original GimuFrontier C# code made back in 2022 as a PoC to demonstrate
the feasibility of a server emulator. 

For more information about the strategy of the offline mod/purpose of this server, please check [How the offline mod works](https://decompfrontier.github.io/pages/Architecture/Offlinemod-architecture.html) and [Emulator (Server) architecture](https://decompfrontier.github.io/pages/Architecture/Emulator-architecture.html)
